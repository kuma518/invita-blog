# surge.sh

This recommend, first tutorial shows you how to create **your own website**, for free, using [surge.sh](https://surge.sh).

A website (or a web app) is just a bunch of files, like really anything else that exists on a computer. To be precise a website consists of `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files. You have a folder with these files? You have a website/app, it's that simple.

::: tip Heads up
You need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/de/download/) installed on your computer, check out the [Introduction](./#install-node) on how to get started.

## Write html

A `.html` file is just a normal text file (like `css`, `js`, `py` and lot of others). It is **not** a [binary file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file).

This means you can write html in any text editor, but then you have _to save_ the actual file with an `.html` extension. Instead of saving it as `.txt`, else the browser won't recognize it.
However writing html from scratch, is actually not a really sane way to create webpages. Even we write fairly little HTML, and it usually gets transpiled (parsed and rewritten by a program).

### Find the right tool

There are **a lot** of online tools that dump you a directory of html pages to turn into a website.

Some are no-code/low-code solutions for building web apps, some are website builders, others are just everyday tools that _support html exports_. Like photoshop, that lets you turn your canvas into a normal website. It supports rich text, that can be selected and copied, overall the site feels natural and just works.

For this tutorial, I am going to use [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/). It is so fucking simple and powerfull, it's not even funny. When creating pdfs or documents Google docs is always my preferred alternative to Microsoft Word. It is simpler, more intuitive, reliable (always online, with offline support), has a ton of Add-ons, you can voice type, and is overall just more productive.

On top of all of that, it has an html export, <a href="/Windowsunitssetup.html">check it out</a>!
