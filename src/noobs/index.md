# Introduction

Welcome to the Noobs, tutorials section :page_with_curl:.

Actual web dev is hard, I am not going to lie to you. Still, that doesn't mean that you have to **literally study**, before you can write any code or use the terminal. For that reason we have this section. With a bunch of tutorials (regarding tech we actually use in production) that show you how to get started.

[Check out](./git.md) our tutorial on `git` to setup your machine.
